# 🔁 Circular Singly Linked List in C

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates a **menu-driven Circular Singly Linked List** implemented in the C programming language. It supports all major operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and counting nodes.

## 🧠 What is a Circular Singly Linked List?

A **Circular Singly Linked List (CSLL)** is a type of linked list where:
- Each node contains:
  - `data`: holds the value
  - `next`: points to the next node
- The last node’s `next` pointer points back to the **head** node, forming a **circle**.

### ✅ Advantages:
- Efficient for applications requiring circular traversals (e.g., round-robin scheduling).
- No need to reset the pointer manually during circular iteration.
