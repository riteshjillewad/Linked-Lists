# ðŸ”¹ Singly Linked List

A **Singly Linked List (SLL)** is a linear data structure in which each element is called a **node**, and each node contains:
- **Data** â€“ The value stored in the node.
- **Next** â€“ A pointer/reference to the next node in the list.  

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations.

## ðŸ”¹ Node Structure in C

```c
struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};
```
---

## ðŸ”¹ Memory Representation
```
Head â†’ [10 | *] â†’ [20 | *] â†’ [30 | NULL]
```
* The `Head` points to the first node.
* The `next` of the last node is NULL indicating the end of the list.
